            </a>
            is one of the most widely consumed teas globally. <br>
            It undergoes full oxidation during processing, which gives it a robust flavor and dark color. <br>
            Popular varieties include Assam, Darjeeling, and Earl Grey. <br>
            Black tea is known for its boldness and is often enjoyed with or without milk and sugar. <br>
            It's a comforting choice for many tea enthusiasts, offering a rich and invigorating experience.

                White tea</a>
            may refer to one of several styles of tea which generally <br>
            feature young or minimally processed leaves of the Camellia sinensis plant.<br>
            Currently there is no generally accepted definition of white tea and very little international<br>
            agreement; some sources use the term to refer to tea that is merely dried with no additional processing,<br>
            some to tea made from the buds and immature tea leaves picked shortly before the buds have fully<br>
            opened and allowed to wither and dry in natural sun, while others include tea buds and very<br>
            young leaves which have been steamed or fired before drying.<br>
